The Programming Group of Team 5881, the Tech Valley High School Dragons, is proud to announce the Open Beta for the
 TBA Slack Bot.

We wish to extend a special thank you to the teams that tested out TBABot during our closed beta and gave us
 important, valuable feedback during the process. Special thanks to teams 3966 and 5012!

If you find any issues, you can feel free to report them to the bot using the __feedback__ command, or on our
 [GitHub Issue Page][gh-issues] when available.
