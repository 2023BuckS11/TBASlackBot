The Programming Group of Team 5881, the Tech Valley High School Dragons, is proud to announce the TBA Slack Bot
 has been updated to work with The Blue Alliance APIv3.

Quite a bit did change in the backed of the TBA Slack Bot, so we ask any users to report problems using the *_feedback_*
 command, or open an issue on GitHub.
