The Unofficial TBA Slack Bot was written and developed for the _FIRST&reg;_ Robotics Competition community using the 
 APIs and services of [The Blue Alliance](https://www.thebluealliance.com). This is *not* an official product or 
 service of The Blue Alliance, and we thank them for the services and APIs they provide to the community.

Users are encouraged to provide feedback using the built-in bot __feedback__ command. Bugs and issues can be 
 reported via __feedback__ as well, or via a GitHub issue.
