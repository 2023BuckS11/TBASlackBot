    <title>The Blue Alliance (Unofficial) Slack Bot Setup</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>The Blue Alliance<sup style="font-size: 50%">Unofficial</sup> Slack Bot Setup</h1>
<p>The Blue Alliance<sup>Unofficial</sup> Slack Bot is an <b>Un-Official</b> project from the Programming Group of
    FRC Team 5881, the Tech Valley High School Dragons and is not an official The Blue Alliance service. The bot was
    originally intended to mirror the official TBA twitch bot for Slack teams.</p>
<p>Currently, the bot is in a late-<b>alpha</b> state, with most query functions working properly. That said,
    iteration in development has been on features and functions, not stability. In other words, you may find ways to
    break the bot.</p>
<p>If you are interested in testing, please feel free to add the bot to your Slack team with the link below,
    after reading the instructions and warnings.</p>
<h2>How to Use the Bot - and some Warnings</h2>
<p>After setting up the bot, the bot will message the user that set it up with some basic information. By default,
    the bot does not join any channels (including #general on your team). Team members can open a DM with the bot
    and issue commands. Team members with appropriate permissions can <b>/invite</b> the bot into other channels.</p>
<p><b>WARNING:</b> The Slack Event API (which the bot uses to receive messages) does not allow me, or you, to filter
    what messages are received. The bot will receive <b>every message</b> in the channels the bot is in.</b> Currently
    all messages the bot receives are logged temporarily to aid with debugging, therefore nothing said in a channel
    the bot has been invited to is private. The message logging will change eventually as development moves on as I
    have no interest in your channel chat. If this concerns you, simply don't invite the bot to any channels.</p>
<h3>Interacting with the bot</h3>
<p>The bot behaves slightly differently in a DM channel than other channels. In a DM channel you only need type your
    command and the bot will respond. Everything typed in a 1:1 DM channel is considered a command. In a group or
    regular channel, the bot is listening for it to be mentioned by name, eg <i>@tbabot</i>. In a non-DM channel you
    can issue conversational commands in most cases. As long as all optional parameters to the command are included
    the bot will ignore anything before it's name, or after the last command parameter expected.</p>
<p>For example in a regular channel: "Guys did you know you can ask @tbabot info 5881 and get information on a team?"
    or in a DM just type "info 5881"</p>
<p>Command details are available by asking the bot for <b>help</b> in any channel</p>
<h3>Subscribing to teams</h3>
<p><b>(Alpha Feature)</b> You can subscribe to team competition updates on a channel-by-channel basis with the bot.
    So your #general channel may subscribe to your team, but your DM channel may follow 254. Following a team across
    multiple channels is supported, but you may find it gets a bit spammy as a user. As this feature is
    being developed in the offseason, there are not any 'official' events ongoing with which to test, and the feature
    is coded to the "it should work" standard.</p>
<p>Presently there are 3 subscription types, <b>all</b>, which will give you exactly what you ask for, any update from
    the TBA webhooks involving that team (upcoming match, match score, awards), <b>result</b> which will only send
    match result updates, and finally <b>summary</b> which will give the team's final status at a completed event.
    (summary is sent when awards are posted - if there are no awards in an offseason event, this will not trigger)</p>
<h3>About bot permissions</h3>
<p>The bot requests a number of permissions when you set it up. Many are used today, some are added for
    soon-to-be-added features, and some are for future-proofing. Here's a list of the permissions we request and why
    we request them (As shown in the authorization screen):</p>
<ul>
    <li>Confirm your identity -- This is added by Slack, we don't request it.</li>
    <li>Access information about your channels and direct messages -- As the bot is added to / removed from channels
        we use this permission to keep an updated channel list of where the bot has access to, and what kind of
        channel it is.</li>
    <li>Access information about your team -- This is a future-proofing request. The information we can access from
        this only contains name, domain, and icon information.</li>
    <li>Access your team's Do Not Disturb settings -- This is for a not-too-distant feature. This allows the bot to
        see if a user is in do not disturb mode, and with the planned feature, not disturb you with any team
        updates until you return.</li>
    <li>Access your profile and your team's profile fields -- This is for a near feature, to reference the requester
        by name in replies and make the conversational parser a bit more "human"</li>
    <li>Send messages as The Blue Alliance Slack Bot -- Self explanatory</li>
    <li>Add a bot user with the username @tbabot -- Self explanatory</li>
    <li>Access your team's profile information -- See the profile access description above.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Updates and Improvements</h2>
<p>The bot is currently being updated almost daily with improvements and updates. We strongly encourage users to
    use the <b>help changelog</b> command to keep on top of changes and new features.</p>
<h2>Bug, Problem, Feature Requests</h2>
<p>For the time being, feel free to contact <i>bdaroz</i> on either Chief Delphi or Reddit. I typically check them a
    few times during the day and will get back to you fairly quickly. Beta testers that received an email with setup
    instructions may also email the sender for assistance as well. (In other words, I'd list my email here if I
    didn't already get enough SPAM.)</p>
